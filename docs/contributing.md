# Contributing to the Java on Mobile Organization

Welcome! This organization hosts multiple projects aimed at **bringing real OpenJDK Java to mobile platforms**. Our goal is to provide code, tools, and documentation that allow developers to build libraries and applications for mobile devices using standard Java.

---

## Projects in This Organization

Some of the current and planned projects include:  

- **OpenJDK/mobile** – downstream OpenJDK repository with minimal patches for iOS/Android.  
- **Build and CI tools** – GitHub Actions for continuous builds of mobile JDKs.  
- **AOT / performance experiments** – strategies to improve runtime performance on mobile.  
- **JavaFX on mobile** – integration of OpenJFX with the OpenJDK build system.  

Each project may have its own repository, README, and issue tracker. Contributions should target the specific project most relevant to your work.

## How to Contribute

1. **Identify the project** you want to contribute to. Check the project README for contribution guidelines.  
2. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch.  
3. **Implement your changes**, following the coding conventions of that project.  
4. **Submit a pull request**, explaining:  
   - What the change does  
   - How it aligns with the project mission and core architecture  
   - Any dependencies or interactions with other sub-projects

## Alignment with the Mission

All contributions should support the **mission and core architecture**:

- Ensure the change advances **real OpenJDK Java on mobile platforms**.  
- Avoid mobile-specific workarounds unless necessary.  
- Respect existing design patterns and build system conventions.  
- Aim for maintainability and potential upstreaming to OpenJDK.  

This applies across all sub-projects. Contributions that diverge may require additional review.
